# Investigate-a-Dataset
My Udacity project on investigating no-show rate for medical patients

# Introduction
The dataset holds information collected from around 100k hospital appointments in Brazil. Patients whom data is collected in this dataset are anonymous and the information captured holds the dates when appointment was originally scheduled and when the appointment had place, patient ID, appointment ID, patient's age, gender, enrollement into 'Bolsa Familia' social program, intication if patient falls under one of medical categories such as hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, whether they are handicap and if they received an SMS reminder and if they showed up or not. The Neighbourhood column indicates where the hospital was located, not where the patient was from.

I posted some research questions for my analysis:

Are gender, age and enrollement into social program correlated with no-show appointments?
Is any of the groups suffering from hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism or handicap more likely to miss their appointments?
Are there addictional factors that might influence the no_show rate? Perhaps the day of the appointment?
